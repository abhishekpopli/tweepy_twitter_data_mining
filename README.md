# tweepy_twitter_data_mining
 Tweepy. An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.  The first step is the registration of your app. In particular, you need to point your browser to http://apps.twitter.com, and register a new application.
A very easy to use library, available on GitHub.
In this project, I read the 10 leatest tweets of mine, then all of the tweets and listed my followers. We can store the result in JSON format for better utilization and storage.
